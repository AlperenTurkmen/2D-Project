# Pick Up Mushrooms Bug Fixes README

## Overview
This README details the fixes implemented for two major bugs encountered in the NPC dialogue system:

1. **Dialogue Words Scrambling**: A bug where the dialogue text would scramble or mix multiple lines when the player skipped the dialogue before it was fully typed out.
2. **Skipping Multiple Lines at Once**: A bug that allowed the dialogue to advance incorrectly when the player tried to skip multiple lines, causing the dialogue to overlap or appear incorrect.
3. **Log Blocking Character**: A rigidbody log that was unintentionally blocking the character's movement.

## Bug Descriptions and Solutions

### 1. Dialogue Words Scrambling
- **Issue**: When the player pressed the skip button before the dialogue finished typing, the next line was concatenated with the previous incomplete line, resulting in a scrambled and unreadable text.
- **Solution**: The problem was solved by adding a method called `CompleteTyping()`. This method stops the typing coroutine and immediately completes the display of the current dialogue text. When a player skips the dialogue, `CompleteTyping()` ensures that the current line is fully rendered before proceeding to the next, preventing any scrambled words.
  
  **Changes Made**:
  - Added `CompleteTyping()` method to stop the typing coroutine and set the full text immediately.
  - Updated the `Update()` method to call `CompleteTyping()` when the skip button (`KeyCode.E`) is pressed during typing.
  - Ensured that `dialogueText.text` is cleared properly before starting new lines to avoid overlapping text.

### 2. Skipping Multiple Lines at Once
- **Issue**: When the player attempted to skip multiple lines in quick succession, the dialogue system did not handle the coroutine management properly, causing dialogue lines to overlap and display incorrectly.
- **Solution**: To solve this, `StopAllCoroutines()` was used to ensure that any ongoing coroutine is terminated before starting a new one. This ensured that each line of dialogue was properly separated and displayed without overlap.
  
  **Changes Made**:
  - Added `StopAllCoroutines()` in the `NextLine()` and `ResetDialogue()` methods to make sure no typing coroutine was left running when advancing or resetting the dialogue.
  - Cleared `dialogueText.text` before starting new coroutines to guarantee that no text from previous lines was left over.

### 3. Log Blocking Character
- **Issue**: A rigidbody log was blocking the character's movement, causing unintended gameplay issues.
- **Solution**: The log was moved out of the way to prevent interference with the character's path.

  **Changes Made**:
  - Adjusted the position of the log in the scene to ensure it no longer obstructs the character's movement.

## Updated Methods Summary

### `CompleteTyping()`
```csharp
private void CompleteTyping()
{
    StopCoroutine(nameof(Typing));
    dialogueText.text = dialogue[currentIndex];
    isTyping = false;
}
```
- Stops the current typing coroutine and immediately completes the display of the dialogue text.

### `NextLine()`
```csharp
public void NextLine()
{
    if (currentIndex < dialogue.Length - 1)
    {
        currentIndex++;
        StopAllCoroutines();
        dialogueText.text = ""; // Clear the previous text completely
        StartCoroutine(Typing());
    }
    else
    {
        ResetDialogue();
    }
}
```
- Ensures that any existing coroutine is stopped before advancing to the next line.
- Clears previous dialogue text before starting the typing coroutine.

### `ResetDialogue()`
```csharp
private void ResetDialogue()
{
    StopAllCoroutines();
    dialogueText.text = "";
    currentIndex = 0;
    dialoguePanel.SetActive(false);
    isTyping = false;
}
```
- Stops all ongoing coroutines to prevent any residual typing.
- Clears the dialogue text and resets all necessary variables.

## Conclusion
The above fixes ensure a smoother dialogue experience by addressing both text scrambling and incorrect skipping behavior. The dialogue now functions as intended, allowing players to skip lines without scrambling words or overlapping multiple lines of dialogue.

Additionally, the rigidbody log blocking the character's movement was moved to ensure unobstructed gameplay, enhancing the overall user experience.
